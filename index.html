        <h2>Hi, my name is Arya </h2>
        <img src="static/photo.png" alt="your full name profile image" width="350px">
        <p id="intro">My name is Arya, and I am an Information Systems Major at Carnegie Mellon University. 
            I am constantly driven by my passion for technology, problem solving, and team building, which is why I decided to make my future focus on these elements. 
            Outside of academics, I enjoy playing and listening to music, as well as watching sports.
            This includes all genres, from classical to hip hop, UFC to basketball. 
             I also play the tabla, an instrument I have been learning since elementary school, and has allowed me to express myself in ways other fields cannot. I love learning new things about myself, and the world around me, whether this be through picking up new hobbies or just learning from class.
              This website showcases projects that I have worked on, my current interests, and what I look forward to. 
              If there are any questions, or you want to reach out, don't hesitate to use the contact form!</p>
